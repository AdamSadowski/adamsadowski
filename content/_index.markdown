I’m a biostatistician in training. I studied philosophy, psychology, and statistics. Here you can find examples of my R code and statistical analyses, my writing and music.

Currently I assist doctors with the analysis of data for the [DOLORisk](http://dolorisk.eu/) project. The data sets contain a full Cohort Profile in the International Journal of Epidemiology, describing lifestyle, medical history, prescribing, genotype, cognitive function and psychology. The task of analyzing this data is to identify risk factors for chronic pain (resulting from injury to the body’s nervous system).

I built this site using blogdown and the hugo-xmin theme. I found [this guide](https://alison.rbind.io/post/up-and-running-with-blogdown/) the easiest to follow in getting started.

Here's the central limit theorem.

`$${\sqrt {n}}\left(\left({\frac {1}{n}}\sum _{i=1}^{n}X_{i}\right)-\mu \right)\ {\xrightarrow {d}}\ N\left(0,\sigma ^{2}\right)$$`

All pages not under the root directory of the website are listed below. You can also visit the list page of a single section, e.g., [posts](/post/), or [notes](/note/). See the [About](/about/) page for the usage of this theme.
