# Adam Sadowski

Iâ€™m a biostatistician in training. I studied philosophy, psychology, and statistics. Here you can find examples of my R code and statistical analyses, my writing and music. 

Currently I' have the task of'm engaged in analysing data to identify risk factors for chronic pain as part of the [DOLORisk](http://dolorisk.eu/) project. The data sets contain a Cohort Profile in the International Journal of Epidemiology describing lifestyle, medical history, prescribing, genotype, cognitive function and psychology.

I built this site using blogdown and the hugo-xmin theme. I found [this guide](https://alison.rbind.io/post/up-and-running-with-blogdown/) the easiest to follow in getting started.
